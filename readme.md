# Welcome to IOLab Master Repository
---
## Objective
This repository will provide the material necessary to teach [Information Organization Laboratory](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i290ta) (or other similar [The Discipline of Organizing](http://disciplineoforganizing.org/) inspired course).

## Repository Structure
The repository consists of five top level directories and one main organizing document that provides the mapping between course topics and the files within the repositories.

The contents of each directory are explained below:
- **Lectures:** Contains subdirectories for each lecture. Each subdirectory contains a Microsoft PowerPoint file of the lecture. Lectures with labs will also include a subdirectory called "Labs" that will include:
    1. A Microsoft Word document with directions for the lab
    2. The supporting code for the lab
    3. (optionally) the code for the completed lab
- **Homeworks:** Contains directories (names *do not* correspond to lecture names)
  - Each subdirectory contains:
    1. A Microsoft Word document with directions for the homework
    2. The supporting code for the homework
    3. (optionally) the code for the completed homework
- **Projects:** Contains subdirectories for projects and corresponding material and instructions.
- **Teaching Resources:** Contains material for instructors. These may be PDFs, HTML, or Microsoft Word Documents containing links to external documents that are related to the class as a whole (Material related to a particular course topic should go in the Teaching Resources.docx file with each lecture directory).
